This is just a simple app turned complex for learning purposes. 
I plan on making a gui for it and constantly adding new features.
alot of this is broken but I am doing my best to keep what works visable and broken stuff local.
If you read this a look at my code please note that im new and self taught.
I am happy to get feedback and critisim.


---About the App---

the main purpose is to store the current months bills and paychecks in self contained database with sqlite.
It will then take the bills and do basic math on how much is owed this month and your remaining amount.
it tells wat bills are paid and what is left along with have you got paid yet and how much.
It will also pay my bills online for me with selenuim.
My current project is to decide which bills need to be paid this pay check and which will be paid next without being late.
